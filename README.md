# Landing Page - ROXY
This page is only available for tablets and phones. Desktop - work in progress.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the dist folder.

`npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. If you want to use it you need to do npm run build first.

The page will reload if you make edits.

!Important
You need to change path of css to dist in the main html.

Example:

From css/main.css to dist/css/main.css

`npm run dev`

It's runs npm run start and npm run dev at the same time.
I recommend using this.
